/**
 * Represents a position in an organisation
 * Normal positions have a role (and could have further information)
 * A manager is a position that has a non empty team consisting of
 *   a set of positions.
 *   (If a position has an empty team, then it is not a manager.)
 * All positions (other than the CEO) have a manager, the position
 *   that this position reports to.
 *
 * A position is drawn as a rectangle, labeled with the role
 * Every Position (except the CEO) will be drawn with a link to 
 *   their manager.
 * Every Position is drawn one layer down from its manager, at a horizontal
 *  location specified by the position's offset, which specifies how far
 *  to the right (or left) of the location of the manager.
 *   This means that if the manager is moved around on the screen, 
 *   the team members (and their team members, and ....) will
 *   automatically move with them.
